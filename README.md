# Landing Page Project

#### By **Moshe Atia Poston**

## Description

This project is a practical exercise I completed following Brad Traversy's Udemy course '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript'. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with Vanilla JavaScript by creating a fully functional landing page.

In this project, a landing page was constructed with various features such as:

- A navigation bar with a logo and different site sections.
- The main header that includes a "Sign Up" button that triggers a modal.
- Content sections to present what the landing page is about, including additional sections like "Tell Me More" and "Benefits".
- A "Sign Up" modal that appears upon clicking the "Sign Up" button. This modal contains a form for users to enter their name, email, and password to register.
